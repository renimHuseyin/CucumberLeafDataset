# CucumberLeafDataset
A leaf image dataset for cucumber disease classification.
# Cucumber Leaf Disease Dataset (CLD-1247)

The CLD-1247 dataset contains a total of **1,247 RGB images** of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves classified into four categories for visual disease analysis:

- `Normal` (213 images)
- `Spotted` (300 images) – indicative of leaf spot diseases
- `WormDamaged` (399 images) – due to insect or pest damage
- `IronDeficiency` (335 images) – visible nutrient deficiency signs

All images are collected in controlled agricultural environments with varying lighting, angle, and background conditions to simulate real-world settings.

The dataset is designed for machine learning applications including:
- Plant disease classification
- Mobile leaf diagnostic tools
- Agricultural automation and AI

The images are provided in a compressed `.zip` file with labeled folders. Image resolution may vary.
